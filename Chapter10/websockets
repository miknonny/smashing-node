Websockets.
websockets consists of two parts.
websockets api implemented by the browsers.
websockets protocol implemented by servers.

websockets are implemented as part of the html5 directive.
the former is standardized by w3c and the later is standardized by IETF.

var ws = new WebSocket('ws://host.path');
ws.onopen = function () {
	alert(ev.data);
}


ws.onclose = function () {};

ws.ondata = function (ev) {
	alert(ev.data);
}


The simplicity of this data is not coincidental. reminiscent of the tcp client that we wrote.

here http headers are send only once.
as soon as the connection is establisned only data is sent through.

An echo example.
Now let us setup an echo server and client that are exchanging both ping and pong strings.

Its important to note that websockets handles anly the websocket request.
all other request are still handles buy your http server.

Echo implementation of websckets.


Limitations of websockets.
Older browsers do not support it. as it is only compliant with html5 browsers.
This are the problems in which socket.io tries to fix in the next chapter
